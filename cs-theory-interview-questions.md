## Questions:

- [x] What is recursion and give an example using Javascript?
- **Explain:** is a technique used to solve problems by creating a function that calls itself until your program achieves the desired result.
- **Use:** to break down complex problems into the smallest solutions.
- **Example:** print numbers to count down to the value to 1.

// program to count down numbers to 1
function countDown(number) {
    //display the number
    console.log(number);

    //decrease the number value
    const newNumber = number -1;
